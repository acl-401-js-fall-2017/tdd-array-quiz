# Quiz: TDD and Array Methods

**Use standard lab submission procedure**

Write a tested library function (a function exported from a module) that takes an array of numbers (you can assume valid input)
and returns another array that contains the square of those numbers, filtered to only contain those squares
greater than 20.

Input | Output
---|---
[1, 4, 5, 7] | [25, 49]

Besides your `lib` and `tests`, your repo should include:
* `package.json`
* `.travis.yml`
* `.gitignore`
* `.eslintrc`

Quiz is open book, internet, etc...

Goal is have PR with passing travis by end of alotted time.
